# worm.asm
This program allows the user to control a worm around the display screen using multiple key commands (a, w, s, d). The user can also control the color of the worm with r (red), b (blue), g (green), y (yellow), space (white). If enter is pressed, the screen is cleared. If q is pressed, the program quits.
